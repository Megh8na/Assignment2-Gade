> Getting First and Last Items in Array (and splitting all the rest)

> I need to get the last element of a split array with multiple separators. The separators are commas and space. If there are no separators it should return the original string.
If the string is "how,are you doing, today?" it should return "today?"
If the input were "hello" the output should be "hello".
How can I do this in JavaScript?
